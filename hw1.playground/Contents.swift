//: ## Q1: Optionals
class Words {
    var wordA : String!
    var wordB : String!
    
    init (wordA: String?, wordB: String?) {
        self.wordA = wordA
        self.wordB = wordB
    }

//: ### Are the values passed in to the **init** function and those set to the instance
//: ### variables the same type? If not, why?


//: The values passed in to the **init** function has to be a wrapped String while the 
//: instance variables take in forcibly unwrapped Strings (initially wrapped) so my
//: answer would be: sometimes. If the value passed into the **init** function happens
//: to be a wrapped nil, then it would not be the case. Otherwise, it would.


//: ## Q2: Variable Types and Function Types
    class func arePalindromes(words: [String]) -> Bool {
        let reversedWords = words.map() {String($0.characters.reverse())}
        let numElements = words.count
        
        for var i = 0; i < numElements; i++ {
            if words[i] != reversedWords[i] {
                return false
            }
        }
        return true
    }
//: ### Why does the compiler dislike the **for loop**? Fix it.
//: ### What else is wrong with this function? You may have to refer to (but **not**
//: ### change) the code at the very bottom. Debug the function.


//: In the for loop, we use the variable i to keep track of where we are in words and 
//: reversedWords; in order to do that, we increment i at each iteration. However, you
//: are not allowed to change something declared with let. Similarly, we never change
//: numElements so it makes more sense to declare it with a let.

            if let val = countLetters[letter] {
                countLetters[letter] = val + 1
            } else {
                countLetters[letter] = 1
            }
        }

            if let val = countLetters[letter] {
                countLetters[letter] = val - 1
            } else {
                return false
